# How to delegate ADA

* **See this link for an explanation on delegation:**  [**https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/**](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/)\*\*\*\*
* **You always maintain full control of your ADA in your own wallet when you delegate.**
* **The first step to delegating your ADA is to download one of the official Cardano wallets.**
