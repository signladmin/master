### **Welcome to the ADA-Pi project's information and tutorials section.** We are a community of RPi-ARM Cardano Stake Pool Operators who aim to provide support and free educational resources to future Stake Pool Operators. 

###  Although our focus is RPi-ARM stake pool operations, we will provide a wide range of information, tutorials, and resources for developing on Cardano. If you would like to know more about the ADA-Pi project and our goals, please see our Fund4 proposal on _Project Catalyst_ for details or join our _Discord_.
