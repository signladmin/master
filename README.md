# Auto-generated translation branch

This branch contains translations of the `master` branch. To change the files
in this branch you must [add translations to the Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/armada-alliance-gitbook).
Once the translations are approved in Crowdin, Crowdin will generate a PR to
this repo. Once that PR is merged, this branch will be updated. Any changes to
this branch will be overwritten whenever there are new translations from Crowdin.
