### **Welcome to the Armada Alliance's information and tutorials section.** We are a community of ARM-based Cardano Stake Pool Operators who aim to provide support and free educational resources to future Stake Pool Operators.

### Although our focus is ARM stake pool operations, we will provide a wide range of information, tutorials, and resources for developing on the Cardano blockchain. If you would like to know more about the project and our goals, please see our Fund4 proposal on _Project Catalyst_ for details or join our _Discord_.
